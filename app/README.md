Note: It is a best practice to pass a modifier to every composable and set it to a default value.

Warning: Singleton pattern is not a recommended practice. Singletons represent global states that are hard to predict, particularly in tests. Objects should define which dependencies they need, instead of describing how to create them.

Use Dependency injection over singleton pattern, you will learn how to implement Dependency injection in a later codelab.
